In the rails setup lesson there are couple of things...

1. "Now, we can create our databases just like before with rake db:create."

  Just like before?  We haven't done this before...unless I missed something.


2. "Now we can migrate and prepare our test database just like we did before.
  And just like before, there's now a schema.rb file in db."

  Again, haven't seen this before.  So the command to actually
  run the migration (e.g. rake db:setup ) is something I had to search
  for. May also want to touch on the setup of the development AND the test
  databases.

3. "We can run $ rspec to watch it fail, just like before. Let's make
  it pass, by creating a contact.rb file in app/models"

  When we run the rspec command it fails but not with a "failure"
  condition. The command actually fails. (see below)

4. require "spec-helper" should now be require "rails-helper"
